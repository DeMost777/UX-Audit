-- Step 1: Make bucket public and configure it
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'design-uploads',
  'design-uploads',
  true,
  52428800,
  ARRAY['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE
SET 
  public = true,
  file_size_limit = 52428800,
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg'];

-- Step 2: Remove old policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload own files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public read access" ON storage.objects;

-- Step 3: Create upload policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own files"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'design-uploads' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Step 4: Create view policy (for authenticated users)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own files"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'design-uploads' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Step 5: Create delete policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own files"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'design-uploads' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Step 6: Create PUBLIC read policy (THIS IS THE KEY FIX!)
CREATE POLICY "Public read access"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT
  USING (bucket_id = 'design-uploads');
